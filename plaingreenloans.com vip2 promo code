It’s possible to get a personal loan for $500 or even less, but it can be difficult. Most banks, credit unions, or online lenders don’t offer loans this small because the cost of administering the loan would be greater than the profit they would make. For this reason, most banks and credit unions don’t offer personal loans for less than $1,000.
However, you can get a loan for $500 in a number of ways. These options include payday loans and loans through loan apps. Some of these loans have other benefits. You can receive them fairly quickly, and they may not require a credit check. However, they may also have much higher interest rates than the personal loans offered through traditional lenders.
